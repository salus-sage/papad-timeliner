# Module install

This is a tool to install NPM modules, taking into account Lerna weirdness and Yarn workspaces.

```javascript
const moduleInstall = require('@fesk/module-install');

moduleInstall('fs-extra@^5.0.0');
```

Running this will get you:

```
ℹ Detected lerna project
ℹ Detected yarn workspaces
✔ Successfully installed fs-extra@^5.0.0
```

If you install a local package:

```
ℹ Detected lerna project
ℹ Detected local lerna package
✔ Successfully installed @fesk/plugin-metalsmith@^1.0.0
```

Second option lets you turn of logging or change the directory:

```javascript
moduleInstall('fs-extra@^5.0.0', {
  log: false,
  packagePath: './somewhere/else',
  dev: true, // --save-dev option
});
```

It returns a promise, so can be used by other tools.

Its possible we could turn this in a bin, as a quick command-line tool for installing packages without the problems of Lerna/Yarn/NPM!
