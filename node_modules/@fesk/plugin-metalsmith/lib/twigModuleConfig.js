/**
 * Twig module
 *
 * Process:
 *   1 - Copy template folder
 *   2 - Copy assets from dist
 *   3 - Copy template
 *   4 - Deploy to branch (module/silex-provider) https://github.com/X1011/git-directory-deploy
 *
 * Twig caveats:
 *  - Macros have to include their own dependencies individually
 *  - When including TwigProvider for the assets, the expected root
 *    directory is ./web and the assets will go into web/assets
 *
 * Twig module needs to:
 *  - Generate twig extension for injecting assets
 *  - Generate Silex provider for loading all this logic
 *  - Generate Post install script for moving assets (maybe based on config composer.json?)
